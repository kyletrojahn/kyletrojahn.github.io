          <b>Welcome!</b> I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
          at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in American Politics & Public Policy, I specialize in the 
          policy agenda-setting of sub-national political institutions. I am particularly interested in partisan polarization's influence on local school boards 
          and city councils.
          <br><br>
          I'm a first-generation college student and proud product of public education at the pre-K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level. 
          Before my move to Austin, I worked at Washington University in St. Louis' Department of Education in St. Louis, MO as the Faculty Support Coordinator.
          Prior to my work at WashU, I received a B.S. in Political Science & International Relations (with honors and Phi Beta Kappa) from 
          <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a> in Kirksville, MO. At Truman, I conducted a variety of research projects on sub-national, national, 
          and international education policy.
