Welcome! 

I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
  at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. My substantive subfields are American Politics & Public Policy.<br><br>
  
  Broadly, I study education politics, local politics, and partisan polarization. I am particularly interested in the influence of partisan polarization on the policy agenda-setting of local school boards and city councils.
