          <b>Welcome!</b> I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
          at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in American Politics & Public Policy, I am interested in studying the 
          policy agenda-setting of sub-national political institutions and local/urban politics. I am particularly interested in the influence of partisan polarization on the policy 
          agendas of city councils, state legislatures, and local school boards.
          <br><br>
          I'm proud to be a first-generation college student and product of public education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level. My academic career
          began at <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a> in Kirksville, MO where I completed a B.S. in Political Science & International Relations 
          (with honors and Phi Beta Kappa). At Truman, I conducted a variety of research projects on sub-national, national, and international education policy.
          Following undergrad, I moved back to my hometown of St. Louis, MO. Here, I joined <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis'<a> <a href="https://education.wustl.edu/">Department of Education</a>
          as the Faculty Support Coordinator. At WashU, I supported faculty researching the intersection of politics, education, and social equity.
