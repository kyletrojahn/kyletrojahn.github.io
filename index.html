          <b>Welcome!</b> I am an incoming Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
          at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in American Politics & Public Policy, I study the policy agenda-setting of local political institutions. I am particularly interested in partisan 
          polarization's influence on local school boards and city councils.
          <br><br>
          I'm a first-generation college student and proud product of public education at the pre-K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level. Before my move to Austin, TX, 
          I received a B.S. in Political Science & International Relations (with honors and Phi Beta Kappa) from <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a> in Kirksville, MO.
