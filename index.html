          <b>Welcome!</b> I am a M.A. (en route to a Ph.D.) student in Political Science in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
          at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in American Politics & Methodology, I study local/urban politics. I am interested in the politics of 
          local public policy and local political participation. Areas of interest include: urbanism, gentrification, climate policy, and transportation policy.
          <br><br>
          In terms of current research experience, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://acee.princeton.edu/">Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. 
          I am working on the NSF-funded DRMS project "Collaborative Research: Responses to complex disruptive events: Cognition in a socio-political context" (2049796) to examine political participation in coastal communities negatively affected by climate change and social inequality.  
          I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://soa.utexas.edu/planning">Department of Regional & Community Planning</a> at <a href="https://soa.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture</a>. I am working on a National Academies’ National Cooperative Highway Research Program-funded project “Guidance for Implementing
Equitable Transportation Decision-Making” (NCHRP 08-162) to investigate how key organizational features and practices of state and regional transportation agencies facilitate or constrain equity in transportation policy decision-making.
  I also previously served as the State & Local Policy Fellow for the Advocacy Team at the education and tech policy non-profit <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>.
          <br><br>
          I'm proud to be a first-generation college student and product of public education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level. My academic career
          began in rural Missouri at <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a> where I completed a B.S. in Political Science & International Relations 
          (with honors and Phi Beta Kappa). At Truman, I conducted a variety of research projects on sub-national, national, and international education policy.
          Following undergrad, I moved back to my hometown of St. Louis, MO. Here, I joined <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis'<a> <a href="https://education.wustl.edu/">Department of Education</a>
          as the Faculty Support Coordinator. At WashU, I supported faculty researching the intersection of politics, education, and social equity.
