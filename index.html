          <b>Welcome!</b> I am a Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">Department of Government</a>
          at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in American Politics & Quantitative Methodology, I am interested in studying  
          local/urban politics. I am particularly interested in the influence of partisan polarization and public opinion on municipal boundary reform, city councils, 
          state legislatures, and local school boards.
          <br><br>
          Alongside my PhD, I am also the State Policy Intern for the education and tech policy non-profit <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>.
          <br><br>
          I'm proud to be a first-generation college student and product of public education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate level. My academic career
          began in rural Missouri at <a href="https://www.truman.edu/">Truman State University</a> where I completed a B.S. in Political Science & International Relations 
          (with honors and Phi Beta Kappa). At Truman, I conducted a variety of research projects on sub-national, national, and international education policy.
          Following undergrad, I moved back to my hometown of St. Louis, MO. Here, I joined <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis'<a> <a href="https://education.wustl.edu/">Department of Education</a>
          as the Faculty Support Coordinator. At WashU, I supported faculty researching the intersection of politics, education, and social equity.
